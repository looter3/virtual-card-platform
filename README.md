# Virtual Card Platform

## Overview
A modern, reactive microservices-based platform for managing virtual payment cards and transactions. Built with a focus on scalability, reliability, and maintainability using cutting-edge technologies and best practices.

## Architecture & Design Choices

### Microservices Architecture
The platform is divided into specialized, autonomous services:

- **card-service**: Core service for card management operations
- **transaction-service**: Handles all transaction-related operations
- **card-aggregate-service**: Aggregates card-related data and provides composite operations
- **discovery-server**: Service registry and discovery
- **Common modules**: Shared libraries for cross-cutting concerns

### Technology Stack

#### Core Technologies
- **Java 21**: Latest LTS version with modern language features
- **Spring Boot**: Application framework
- **Spring WebFlux**: Reactive web framework
- **Project Reactor**: Reactive programming library
- **MySQL**: Primary database (with reactive drivers)
- **jOOQ**: Type-safe SQL query builder
- **Maven**: Build and dependency management

#### Supporting Libraries
- **Lombok**: Reduces boilerplate code
- **TestContainers**: Integration testing with containerized dependencies
- **Spring Cloud**: Microservices coordination

### Key Features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- JDK 21
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker (for local development)
- MySQL 8.0+

### Database Setup (Required for Compilation)
This project uses jOOQ for type-safe SQL queries, which requires a live database connection during compilation to generate the necessary entity classes.

1. Create the database and tables:
```bash
# Navigate to database directory
cd database

# Using MySQL CLI (adjust credentials as needed)
mysql -u root -p < schema.sql

# Alternative: Using Docker
docker exec -i mysql-virtualcard mysql -uroot -proot virtualcard < schema.sql
```

### Building the Project
mvn clean install

### Running Services
1. Start the discovery server:
```bash
    cd discovery-server 
    mvn spring-boot:run
```

2. Start core services:
```bash
   cd card-service 
   mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Development Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Import as Maven project
3. Run database migrations
4. Start required services

## Configuration

### Service Discovery
- Automatic service registration
- Dynamic service discovery
- Load balancing support

### Database
- Reactive connection pool settings
- Failover configuration
- Connection timeouts

### Monitoring
- Actuator endpoints
- Metrics collection
- Health checks
